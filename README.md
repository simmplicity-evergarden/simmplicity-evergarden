Hi, I'm Simmplicity(-evergarden)

I'm a hobbyist developer who mostly works in Python, but I'm working my way through learning Rust. 

My biggest creations so far have been my Discord bots (if you're here, you probably saw one in action already):
- Pyralis, my ASFR-themed Discord RP bot
- Luccine, the bot I've made for Rosa's server
- the banner rotation bot for Statue Cafe
